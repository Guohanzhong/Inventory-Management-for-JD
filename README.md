# Inventory-Management-for-JD
This project utilize Machine Learning and Newsvendor Model to make inventory strategy for Jingdong

The Code explanation:
Cost.R：This code is aimed to count final cost when given $x_{ij}$. (It is used in simulation)
model.py：This code is aimed to predict mean and standard and evaluate the model. (It fits for the third part of report)
Ratio.R：This code includes the method of distribution from the whole DC to a single DC
code.R：This code is aimed to count the $p_{j}$ and $c_{i}$ in order to count final cost.
solution.py ：This code includes the construction of factors and the utilization of Robust Method to solve optimal problem. 

Further details could be seen in the report.
