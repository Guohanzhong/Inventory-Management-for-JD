Cost.R：This code is aimed to count final cost when given x_{ij}. (It is used in simulation)
model.py：This code is aimed to predict mean and standard and evaluate the model. (It fits for the third part of report)
Ratio.R：This code includes the method of distribution from the whole DC to a single DC
code.R：This code is aimed to count the p_{j} and c_{i} in order to count final cost.
solution.py ：This code includes the construction of factors and the utilization of Robust Method to solve optimal problem.
